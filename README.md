# Project Name: AI Python Documentation Generation

## Description
The AI Python Documentation Generation project is a Python tool that harnesses the power of the GPT-3.5 Turbo language model to automatically create comprehensive documentation for Python projects. This tool is capable of analyzing Python code, extracting essential information from functions, comments, and variable names, and generating informative README files that provide detailed insights into the project's functionality, usage, and documentation.

## Features
- Efficiently analyzes Python code within a specified project directory.
- Extracts and interprets data from functions, comments, and variable names to create meaningful project documentation.
- Generates a well-structured README file, including sections for project overview, installation, usage, and more.
- Provides a user-friendly command-line interface for straightforward utilization.
